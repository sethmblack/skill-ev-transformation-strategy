# EV Transformation Strategy

Design strategy for transitioning legacy automotive or industrial business to electric/sustainable future while managing current portfolio.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create strategies that greenwash without substantive change
- Design transitions that abandon existing customer commitments without alternatives
- Recommend sustainability claims that are not backed by real action
- Ignore workforce transition and community impact

**If asked to create marketing-only sustainability:** Refuse explicitly. True EV transformation requires operational change, not just messaging.

---

## When to Use

- Legacy automotive company transitioning to electric vehicles
- Industrial company with carbon-intensive operations seeking sustainability
- Organization with "all-electric by 20XX" commitment needing strategy
- Dual portfolio management between legacy and EV products
- Platform/architecture decisions for EV transition

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **current_portfolio** | Yes | Existing products, revenue mix, customer base |
| **ev_capabilities** | Yes | Current EV technology, battery, platform status |
| **commitment** | Yes | Public commitments (e.g., "all-electric by 2035") |
| **market_context** | Yes | Competitive position, regulatory environment, customer demand |
| **constraints** | No | Investment limits, workforce agreements, dealer network |

## Core Philosophy

Mary Barra's "Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, Zero Congestion" vision:

> "At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do."

The principle: **Vision with flexibility. Commit to direction, adapt on timing.**

GM committed to all-electric by 2035, invested $35B in EVs, built the Ultium platform - then adjusted by adding plug-in hybrids when market demanded. The vision remained; the path adapted.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Vision and Commitment

**1.1 Define the North Star**
- What is the ultimate end state?
- What does success look like?
- How does this connect to broader societal value?

**1.2 Set Public Commitments Carefully**
- What commitment can you make confidently?
- What flexibility do you need?
- What happens if the market evolves differently than expected?

**1.3 Connect Strategy to Vision**
- How does each initiative advance the vision?
- What is the logic chain from action to outcome?

### Step 2: Phase 2: Platform Strategy

**2.1 Modular Platform Design**
- Build platforms that can serve multiple vehicle types
- Enable economies of scale across brands and segments
- Design for flexibility (different battery sizes, motor configurations)

**2.2 Battery Strategy**
- Build vs. partner vs. buy for battery cells?
- What chemistry flexibility is needed?
- How do you manage battery supply chain risk?

**2.3 Technology Roadmap**
- What technology capabilities must you own?
- What can be sourced externally?
- What partnerships advance the platform?

### Step 3: Phase 3: Portfolio Transition

**3.1 Product Sequencing**
- What EV products come first?
- How do you build customer acceptance?
- What price points must you cover?

**3.2 Dual Portfolio Management**
- How long does legacy portfolio continue?
- How do you allocate resources between legacy and EV?
- When does EV become primary investment priority?

**3.3 Cannibalization Strategy**
- How do you manage EV cannibalizing legacy sales?
- What is the margin profile during transition?
- How do you maintain profitability?

### Step 4: Phase 4: Infrastructure and Ecosystem

**4.1 Charging Infrastructure**
- What charging partnership or investment is needed?
- How do you address range anxiety?
- What role do you play in infrastructure build-out?

**4.2 Dealer/Channel Transition**
- How does the sales model change?
- What dealer training is required?
- What service model changes are needed?

**4.3 Supply Chain Transformation**
- What suppliers must transition with you?
- What new supplier relationships are needed?
- How do you manage supply chain risk?

### Step 5: Phase 5: Adaptation and Course Correction

**5.1 Market Signals**
- What signals indicate faster or slower EV adoption?
- How do you track customer preference evolution?
- What competitive moves require response?

**5.2 Strategy Adjustment**
- When and how do you adjust the plan?
- What triggers reconsideration of commitments?
- How do you communicate changes?

**5.3 Optionality Preservation**
- What options do you want to preserve?
- What irreversible commitments should you delay?
- How do you balance commitment with flexibility?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| EV adoption slower than expected | Extend dual portfolio; adjust timing without abandoning direction |
| Battery costs not declining as projected | Seek alternative suppliers; adjust price points; consider partnerships |
| Regulatory environment changes | Adapt timeline but maintain flexibility for future tightening |
| Competitive EV makes your product obsolete | Accelerate development; consider partnership or acquisition |
| Customer resistance to EV | Invest in education; address specific concerns; consider PHEVs as bridge |

---

## Constraints

- Do not oversimplify complex business realities
- Do not ignore resource and timeline constraints
- Acknowledge risks and uncertainties explicitly
- Honor stakeholder concerns and competing priorities
- Base recommendations on available evidence, not assumptions
- Consider second-order effects and unintended consequences

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
Current portfolio: 80% ICE trucks and SUVs, 20% sedans; $100B revenue
EV capabilities: First EV launching next year; Ultium-like platform in development
Commitment: "All-electric by 2035"
Market context: Competitor EVs gaining share; regulatory pressure increasing; infrastructure expanding
Constraints: Dealer network committed to; workforce in ICE plants
```

**Output:**

| 3 | 70% | 20% | 10% |
| 5 | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| 7 | 30% | 60% | 10% |
| 10 | 5% | 90% | 5% |
| 2035 | 0% | 100% | 0% |

### Adaptation Triggers

| Signal | Faster Response | Slower Response |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| EV market share >25% | Accelerate Year 3 products | N/A |
| EV market share <10% by Year 3 | N/A | Extend dual portfolio |
| Battery costs -30% | Accelerate mainstream pricing | N/A |
| Competitor EV dominates | Consider partnership | N/A |
| Regulatory acceleration | Accelerate timeline | N/A |

### Workforce Transition
- ICE plant workers: Retraining program (100% offered opportunity)
- Battery plant: 5,000 new jobs by Year 5
- Net employment: Maintain or grow during transition

## Integration

This skill is derived from GM's approach under Mary Barra: "Zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion" vision, Ultium platform strategy, and strategic flexibility demonstrated by adding PHEVs when market conditions warranted.

Use in conjunction with:
- `manufacturing-transformation-framework` for operational transition
- `single-point-accountability-design` for EV program ownership
